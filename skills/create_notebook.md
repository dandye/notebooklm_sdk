# Create NotebookLM Notebook

This skill allows you to create a new NotebookLM workspace notebook using the NotebookLM SDK.

1.  Use the MCP Server `notebooklm` tool `create_notebook(title: str)` to provision the notebook.
2.  Alternatively, you can run the CLI command:
    ```bash
    uv run notebooklm create-notebook "Notebook Title"
    ```
